# UI Design Rules (Tody-like minimal, soft cards, hand-drawn icons)

## Design Goal
Build a calm, minimalist PWA UI with:
- soft card surfaces
- lots of whitespace
- rounded corners
- subtle shadows
- gentle status indicators (dots + small chips)
- friendly hand-drawn/monoline illustrations

Do NOT add gamification, bright gradients, heavy borders, or dense dashboards.

---

## Core Layout
- Mobile-first (iPhone-like), max content width 420px.
- Use consistent page padding: 20px left/right.
- Vertical rhythm: 12–16px between elements, 20–24px between sections.
- Pages follow: Title row (centered title) + optional icon button on right.

### Navigation
- Bottom nav with 3 tabs: Home, Chores, Household.
- Icons are minimal monoline (no filled icons).
- Active tab uses slightly darker text/icon; no loud highlight.

---

## Color + Surface Tokens
Use a warm off-white background and subtle pastel surfaces.

### Base
- App background: off-white / paper (#F6F3EF-ish)
- Card background: white (#FFFFFF)
- Divider lines: very light gray (#E9E4DD-ish)

### Pastels (only for tile backgrounds / small accents)
- Mint / soft green
- Powder blue
- Warm beige / sand
- Soft rose (only for overdue chip)

Rules:
- Never use saturated colors.
- Do not use gradients.
- Pastels appear as very light background tints only.

---

## Typography
- Use a clean sans (system UI font stack).
- Title: 22–24px, semibold.
- Section header ("Areas"): 18–20px, semibold.
- Body: 14–16px, regular.
- Meta text (due, assigned): 12–13px, medium/regular.

Rules:
- Avoid ALL CAPS.
- Avoid heavy bolding. Use weight sparingly.

---

## Cards + Elevation
All content is card-based.

Card rules:
- Border radius: 18–22px.
- Shadow: subtle, soft (low opacity), no harsh outlines.
- No thick borders. If needed, 1px very light stroke.

Tile cards (Areas):
- Large icon/illustration centered or top-aligned.
- Title centered.
- Status dot at top-right.
- Optional small chip at bottom (e.g., “2 Due today”).

---

## Status System (very minimal)
Use only:
- Status dot (top-right on tiles)
- Chip (pill badge) for due/overdue

Dot rules:
- Green = OK
- Yellow = Due today
- Red = Overdue
Keep the dot small (8–10px), with subtle shadow.

Chip rules:
- Rounded pill with light background tint, minimal text.
- Examples: “Due today”, “Overdue”
- Do not stack many chips; max 1 per row element.

---

## House Mood Component
Top card on Home screen:
- Left: small house illustration (48–64px)
- Right: title “House mood” + one sentence.
- No extra statistics in this card.
Mood logic:
- 🙂 All good: no overdue
- 😵 Needs attention: overdue > 0
- 😐 Optional: many due today (only if needed)

Keep it simple and calm (no shaming language).

---

## Icons & Illustrations
Important: Use TWO icon styles:
1) Functional UI icons (gear, plus, nav icons): monoline icon set (e.g., Lucide).
2) Area illustrations (kitchen pot, bathtub, sofa, clipboard) + house mood: hand-drawn SVGs.

Rules:
- UI icons: stroke only, rounded caps, consistent size (20–24px).
- Illustrations: simple black/gray linework + tiny pastel fill + minimal shadow.
- No detailed drawings, no photorealism.

Implementation guidance:
- Create an <Illustration name="kitchen" /> component that renders a local SVG.
- Create a <IconButton> component for consistent gear/plus buttons.

---

## Controls
- Buttons: rounded, soft, no strong gradients.
- Primary action (FAB + button): muted beige circle with plus.
- Forms: simple, spacious, iOS-like.
- Inputs: light background, subtle border, large tap targets (min 44px height).

---

## Screen Composition Rules
Home:
- House mood card
- “Areas” header
- 2x2 area grid
- FAB (+) centered above bottom nav

Chores:
- Card list of templates
- Each item: illustration + title + frequency + “Next: …”
- Tap opens edit screen

Edit chore:
- Large illustration + title
- Sections: Assigned to, Area, Frequency, Checklist (optional)
- Save button pinned low

Household:
- Members list (cards)
- Join code + copy button
- Keep it clean, no extra widgets.

---

## Don’ts
- No gamification, no points, no streaks, no confetti.
- No dense tables.
- No neon colors or heavy contrast.
- No multiple competing floating buttons.
- No modal overload; prefer simple screens.

---

## Definition of Done (UI)
A screen is only done if:
- spacing matches tokens
- typography matches rules
- cards use consistent radius/shadow
- icons follow the two-style rule
- no additional “extra” UI elements were added
